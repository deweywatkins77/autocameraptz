# Auto Camera PTZ

## Purpose
This project will utilize the Avigiloin API to move the nearest cameras to accident and have it face the accident based off GPS coordinates of the 911 CAD call.

The API will be implemented using Nodejs, React, and MSSQL for the backend.

## TODO
Currently the code is not complete enough to upload. Once the skeleton of the program has been built i will 
init commit.
